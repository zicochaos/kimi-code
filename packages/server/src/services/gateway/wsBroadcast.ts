/**
 * `IWSBroadcastService` — server-local transport layer that turns the
 * in-process `IEventService.onDidPublish` firehose into a WS broadcast +
 * durable per-session event journal + replay surface.
 *
 * v2 (IM-style multi-device sync) responsibilities:
 *
 *   1. Extract `sessionId` from each published event (defensive: accepts
 *      both camelCase `sessionId` and snake_case `session_id`). Events
 *      without a session id are dropped with a warn log.
 *   2. Classify events as durable vs volatile (`VOLATILE_EVENT_TYPES`).
 *   3. Durable events: assign the next per-session `seq` (journal offset,
 *      monotonic ACROSS DAEMON RESTARTS), persist to the session's
 *      `SessionEventJournal`, cache in an in-memory tail buffer, fan out.
 *   4. Volatile events: fan out live with the current durable watermark as
 *      `seq` and `volatile: true`. Never journaled, never replayed.
 *   5. Expose replay (`getBufferedSince`) keyed by `{seq, epoch}` cursors:
 *      epoch mismatch or a cursor ahead of the journal → `epoch_changed`
 *      resync; a gap larger than the replay cap → `buffer_overflow` resync
 *      (the client should rebuild via `GET /sessions/{sid}/snapshot`);
 *      otherwise events come from the memory tail or the journal file.
 *   6. Expose `getCursor` so the snapshot route / subscribe acks can hand
 *      clients an authoritative `{seq, epoch}` watermark.
 *
 * Wiring: the impl auto-subscribes to `IEventService.onDidPublish` in its
 * constructor — producers continue to call `eventService.publish(event)`
 * unchanged; the broadcast layer transparently lifts those events onto the
 * wire.
 *
 * Dispose order: this service MUST dispose BEFORE `IEventService` so the
 * `onDidPublish` subscription is detached before the bus tears down its
 * emitter (reverse-construction order in `start.ts` is responsible).
