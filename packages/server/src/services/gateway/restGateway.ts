/**
 * `IRestGateway` DI surface.
 *
 * Wraps the Fastify instance the server constructs at boot so consumer
 * services can inject it without taking a direct `fastify` dependency. The
 * concrete impl forwards `listen()` to Fastify and disposes by calling
 * `app.close()` — Fastify drains in-flight requests then shuts down the HTTP
 * server.
 *
 * Construction-order positioning: registered SECOND (right after ILogService).
 * Dispose order then runs gateway BEFORE logger, which is the safe ordering —
 * Fastify's drain logs through the still-alive pino instance.
 *
 * The interface declares `app` with a structural shape rather than the
 * concrete `FastifyInstance<…, ServerLogger>` generic, so consumers don't
 * need to know about the server's pino-typed instance. Internally
 * `FastifyRestGateway` accepts any FastifyInstance variant via the
 * `FastifyLike` structural type (sidesteps the strict-generic mismatch
 * between Fastify's default `FastifyInstance` and the server's pino-typed
 * variant).

/**
 * Minimum shape we need from a Fastify instance. Avoids the strict-generic
 * mismatch between `FastifyInstance<…, ServerLogger>` and `FastifyInstance`'s
 * default generics that surfaces at the route-options level.
 *
 * `server` (the raw Node `http.Server` Fastify wraps) is required so
 * `WSGateway` can attach a typed `'upgrade'` handler for `/api/v1/ws` without
 * pulling in `fastify-websocket`. Fastify exposes `app.server` after
 * `await app.ready()` (or after `listen()`); we add the typed property here
 * rather than widening to `any` — the anti-corruption discipline matters.
