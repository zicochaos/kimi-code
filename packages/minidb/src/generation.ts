// Persistent index generations (stage 5): the on-disk layout, the manifest
// codec, and the authoritative inventory of MiniDb's persistent files.
//
// A generation is a self-contained, atomically published checkpoint of every
// piece of DERIVED state MiniDb otherwise rebuilds from scratch on open:
// the store image (key -> value/refs + expiry + dt), the dt / secondary /
// compound index states, and each text index's dictionary + postings + doc
// table. Loading a published generation and replaying only the WAL delta past
// its checkpoint replaces the open-time full rebuild (decode every value,
// tokenize the whole corpus, rewrite every postings file).
//
// Layout (under the db directory):
//
//   db.snapshot                 authoritative data (unchanged)
//   db.wal                      authoritative log (unchanged)
//   db.indexes.json             index-definition sidecars (unchanged,
//   db.compound-indexes.json      still the source of truth for definitions)
//   db.textindexes.json
//   generations/
//     g-000001/                 a published generation (immutable)
//       store                   store image (inline values or disk refs)
//       dt.index                DtIndex columns
//       secondary.index         IndexManager indexes
//       compound.index          CompoundIndexManager indexes
//       text-<name>.dictionary  term -> { off, len, df } into the postings file
//       text-<name>.postings    postings records (native PostingsFile format)
//       text-<name>.docs        docID <-> key table, docLen, delta, tombstones
//       snapshot                hard link to (or copy of) the db.snapshot the
//                               generation's disk refs point into
//       manifest.json           written LAST inside the dir (dir contents are
//                               only meaningful with a parseable manifest)
//     g-000002.tmp-<pid>/       an in-flight build (never referenced by CURRENT)
//   CURRENT                     one line: the published generation id
//
// Crash protocol (publish): build into g-N.tmp-*, write + fsync every file,
// fsync the tmp dir, rename to g-N, fsync generations/, then atomically
// replace CURRENT (tmp + rename) and fsync the db dir. CURRENT therefore only
// ever points at a fully fsynced generation; a crash anywhere earlier strands
// a tmp dir the next writer open sweeps. Old generations are removed lazily,
// keeping the current and previous one (the previous shares the WAL anchor
// when no compaction intervened, so it is a real fallback).
//
// Load protocol: read CURRENT -> parse + validate the manifest (unknown
// format version is a structured fallback, never a deletion) -> verify the
// WAL anchor (dev/ino + size >= checkpoint) and, for disk valueMode, the
// snapshot anchor -> load the store image + every index image whose recorded
// definition hash still matches the live sidecar definitions -> replay WAL
// frames past the checkpoint with the normal per-frame op interpretation.
// ANY validation or I/O failure falls back to the legacy full recovery
// (snapshot + whole WAL + full index rebuild); the fallback never mutates or
// deletes authoritative data. See generation-load.ts / generation-build.ts.
//
// This module absorbs stage 9's transitional persistent-files.ts: it owns the
// name/pattern knowledge for every persistent path. It performs no I/O beyond
// tiny manifest/CURRENT reads and writes.
