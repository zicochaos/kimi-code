// src/compaction.ts
//
// WAL compaction (a.k.a. snapshot + rewrite).
//
// This is a NON-BLOCKING variant, modelled on Redis's BGREWRITEAOF and
// Bitcask's merge: while the (potentially large) snapshot is being written,
// writers keep appending to the live WAL — the WAL itself acts as the
// "rewrite buffer". Writes are blocked only for the *rotation* critical
// section at the very end (a flush + a bounded tail copy + two renames).
//
// Phases:
//   1. fence        — flush the WAL, record baseOffset = wal.size. Every write
//                     durable at/before baseOffset is already reflected in the
//                     store (applyOp runs synchronously before the WAL write is
//                     awaited).
//   2. snapshot     — writeSnapshot(store, tmp). NON-BLOCKING. Writers keep
//                     appending to the WAL and mutating the store while we
//                     iterate. The snapshot need NOT be point-in-time: the WAL
//                     tail copied below is replayed last-writer-wins on top of
//                     it, repairing any fuzziness.
//   2.5 pre-copy    — stream WAL[baseOffset .. head] into db.wal.tmp, draining
//                     the bulk of the post-fence tail. NON-BLOCKING. Loops while
//                     the copy is CONVERGING (the remaining delta shrinks fast
//                     enough) and gives up after a few passes otherwise —
//                     chasing a tail under writes that append as fast as the
//                     copy drains would otherwise never terminate, stalling
//                     compaction for as long as the write storm lasts.
//   3. rotation     — BLOCKING critical section: set _rotateLock so new writers
//                     park, seal the old WAL (post-seal appends fail fast and
//                     are retried by the op against the new WAL), flush, then
//                     copy the remaining tail. With the WAL sealed and writers
//                     parked the head no longer moves, so this copy provably
//                     finishes; the pause scales with the tail the pre-copy did
//                     not drain — the same bounded end-of-rewrite pause Redis
//                     accepts for its AOF diff flush.
//   4. bookkeeping  — stats + awaiting onCompacted() (rebuild derived text
//                     postings — yields to the event loop, writers unaffected).
//
// Crash safety: recovery is `load db.snapshot` + `replay db.wal`, last-writer
// wins. We rename the snapshot BEFORE the WAL. If a crash lands between the two
// renames, the new snapshot is paired with the old full WAL — replaying the
// whole old WAL on top of the new snapshot is idempotent for pre-fence frames
// and correct for post-fence frames, so the state is still consistent. The
// reverse order (WAL first) would pair an old snapshot with a truncated new WAL
// and lose pre-fence data.
