// fence + drain, then the atomic copy (temp dir → per-file fsync → manifest →
// rename swap). Everything the flow needs from MiniDb (lifecycle gates,
// compaction state, the write-op tracker, the backup serializer, the WAL) is
// injected through BackupDeps, so this module never imports the MiniDb class
// itself.

 *  after it is not. The copy itself is an atomic commit: persistent files
 *  go to a sibling temp dir, every copied file is fsync'd, the manifest is
 *  written LAST (the commit marker — a manifest on disk implies every file
 *  it lists is fully copied and durable), then the temp dir is renamed over
 *  the destination (an existing previous backup is swapped aside first and

 *  leaves the destination untouched and the temp dir removed — never a half
