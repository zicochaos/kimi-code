// src/cluster/lock-pool.ts
//
// Per-process cache of opened shards.
//
// Writers: MiniDb instances holding the shard's db.lock. While a process
// holds a shard's write lock it is by definition the only writer of that
// shard, so the cached writer's in-memory view is authoritative and current.
// Cached writers are LRU-evicted (only when idle) down to a soft cap.
//
// Readers: read-only MiniDb instances used for keys whose shard this process
// does not currently hold. A MiniDb reader replays snapshot+WAL only at open
// time and would go stale afterwards, so every reader use is guarded by a
// cheap file fingerprint (dev:ino:size:mtimeMs of the shard's WAL, snapshot,
// CURRENT, and every index-definition sidecar — FINGERPRINT_FILES, derived
// from the authoritative generation module so a newly added file can never be
// missed). A change refreshes the reader first:
//  - when only the WAL changed as pure appends on the same inode (tracked by
//    a {dev, ino, size} watermark), the appended frames are scanned and
//    applied incrementally (MiniDb.catchUpFromWal) — O(delta);
//  - anything else (rotation, truncation, a generation switch on CURRENT,
//    snapshot/index-def changes, an offset that turns out not to be a frame
//    boundary) falls back to a close + full reopen — with a published
//    generation that reopen loads the new checkpoint instead of rebuilding
//    every index from the full corpus.
// Because a writer's WAL append is complete before its set() resolves, a read
// that starts after another process's write resolved always observes it.
