/**
 * `TestInstantiationService` — a test-friendly extension of
 * `InstantiationService` that exposes direct `get` / `set` / `stub`
 * helpers so test bodies don't have to thread an `invokeFunction(a => …)`
 * accessor through every assertion.
 *
 * Adapted from krow `testInstantiationService.ts` (in turn the VSCode
 * original). Two divergences from krow:
 *
 *   1. **Ctor signature**: kimi's `InstantiationService` constructor is
 *      `(services, parent, _enableTracing)` (parent second, no `_strict`
 *      mode); krow's is `(services, strict, parent, _enableTracing)`.
 *      The `strict` boolean does not exist in kimi yet — `_throwIfStrict`
 *      was not ported because the daemon never enables it. If a future
 *      phase adds strict mode, surface a 2nd ctor param here.
 *   2. **`createServices` factory**: krow uses `DisposableStore` /
 *      `toDisposable` from `base/`. kimi's `Disposable` class is a
 *      different shape (LIFO subdisposable owner, not a Set). The factory
 *      is therefore omitted from the initial port — `TestInstantiationService`
 *      alone covers >95% of the test surface daemon will need in Phase 2.
 *      Add `createServices` if/when a test fixture needs it.
 *
 * Exported via the subpath barrel `@moonshot-ai/agent-core/di/test` so
 * the main `@moonshot-ai/agent-core` entry stays free of test-only code
 * (no test code leaks into the daemon bundle).

/**
 * A test-friendly extension of {@link InstantiationService}.
 *
 * Convenience surface for tests:
 *  - {@link get} — directly resolve a service without going through an
 *    accessor.
 *  - {@link set} — register or replace a service instance / descriptor.
 *  - {@link stub} — semantic alias for {@link set}, intended for test
 *    overrides where the intent is "replace the real impl with a mock".
 *  - {@link createChild} — return a child `TestInstantiationService`
 *    (krow returns `IInstantiationService`; we narrow to the test type so
 *    callers can keep calling `.stub` / `.get` on the child).
 *
 * Example:
 * ```ts
 * import { TestInstantiationService } from '@moonshot-ai/agent-core/di/test';
 *
 * const ix = new TestInstantiationService();
 * ix.stub(ILogger, { log: vi.fn() } as ILogger);
 * const target = ix.createInstance(SomeClass, 'static-arg');
 * ```
