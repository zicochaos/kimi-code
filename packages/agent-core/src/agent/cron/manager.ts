/**
 * CronManager — Agent-facing facade for the cron scheduler.
 *
 * This layer sits between the raw `CronScheduler` (which knows nothing
 * about agents) and the rest of the agent runtime (Agent / turn /
 * telemetry / tool surface). Its job is small but important:
 *
 *   - own the `SessionCronStore` for this session;
 *   - hand `() => store.list()` to the scheduler so add / delete are
 *     picked up automatically every tick;
 *   - gate fires on `agent.turn.hasActiveTurn` rather than maintaining a
 *     duplicate idle flag — the turn machinery already knows;
 *   - translate a fired `CronTask` into a `steer(...)` call carrying a
 *     `CronJobOrigin`, plus the `cron_fired` telemetry event;
 *   - mirror every store mutation to `<sessionDir>/cron/<id>.json`
 *     (via {@link addTask} / {@link removeTasks}) so that `kimi resume`
 *     can call {@link loadFromDisk} to rehydrate previously-scheduled
 *     tasks. When no `sessionDir` is supplied (subagents, tests,
 *     ephemeral sessions) the manager stays purely in-memory.
 *   - provide a `handleMissed(...)` entry point that future boot-time
 *     missed-task notification will call. Today the scheduler's
 *     `coalescedCount` semantics handle missed fires inline, so this
 *     entry point is not wired by the framework — it stays exposed so
 *     adding a banner later does not require API churn here.
 *
 * The manager does NOT read `Date.now()` directly anywhere; every
 * wall-clock read goes through `this.clocks.wallNow()`. The
 * `no-date-now.test.ts` guard does not list this file (it covers the
 * scheduler / jitter layer), but the same discipline is intentional so
 * bench / test clock injection holds end-to-end.
 *
 * Note on `recurring` semantics: the canonical task representation uses
 * `recurring: boolean | undefined` where `undefined` means recurring
 * (cron tasks default to repeating). One-shot is the explicit
 * `recurring === false` opt-out. Every check in this file uses
 * `task.recurring !== false` to keep that default behaviour even when
 * the field is omitted by the caller.

   *      print a `MaxListenersExceededWarning`. Coupling the binding to

   *
   * Idempotent — repeated calls keep the same listener registered once,
