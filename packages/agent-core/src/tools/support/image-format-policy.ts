/**
 * Provider-accepted image formats — the single source of truth.
 *
 * Model providers accept only PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP image blocks. An
 * `image_url` part carrying any other MIME (AVIF, HEIC, BMP, TIFF, ICO, …)
 * is rejected by the API — and because prompts and tool results persist in
 * the session history, that one part makes every subsequent request fail
 * too ("session poisoning"). Every ingestion point therefore refuses
 * unsupported formats instead of passing the bytes through: ReadMediaFile
 * refuses with a conversion command the model can run, and prompt/MCP
 * ingestion replaces the image with a text notice.
 *
 * The policy is deliberately a closed set, not a denylist: a format is only
 * ever sent when it is known to be accepted. Supporting a new format means
 * adding it to {@link MODEL_ACCEPTED_IMAGE_MIMES}; tailoring the refusal
 * guidance for a newly-seen unsupported format means adding one row to
 * {@link UNSUPPORTED_IMAGE_FORMATS}.
 *
 * Inbound MIME strings are normalized for the DECISION
 * ({@link normalizeImageMime}: case, whitespace, `image/jpg`), but every
 * call site must forward the CANONICAL MIME into the session — strict
 * provider whitelists (e.g. Anthropic's) reject the raw alias, which would
 * re-create the very session poisoning this module exists to prevent.
 *
 * Scope: only inline `data:` images can be gated. A remote http(s) image URL
 * (an MCP `resource_link`, a REST `source.kind: 'url'` part) carries no
 * bytes to inspect, and providers that support URL images fetch them
 * server-side; those pass through unchanged.
