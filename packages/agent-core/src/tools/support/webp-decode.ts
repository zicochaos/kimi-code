/**
 * WebP decoding for the image-compression pipeline.
 *
 * The default jimp build ships no WebP codec, so WebP is decoded with
 * `@jsquash/webp`'s wasm decoder instead. The decoder wasm is compiled from a
 * base64 string committed to the repo (see `webp-dec-wasm.ts`): the published
 * CLI bundles every dependency into a single file with no runtime
 * node_modules, so a file-path or fetch lookup for the .wasm (what the
 * emscripten glue would do on its own) cannot work there — the module is
 * compiled and injected manually via the codec's `init()` hook. Only the
 * decoder is bundled: re-encoding runs through the existing PNG/JPEG ladder,
 * so the (larger) WebP encoder wasm is never needed.
 *
 * The repo's tsconfig carries no DOM lib, so the global `WebAssembly` and
 * `ImageData` names are unavailable at the type level — the wasm namespace is
 * reached through a structurally-typed `globalThis` and the decoder's RGBA
 * output is described by the local {@link DecodedWebp} shape.
