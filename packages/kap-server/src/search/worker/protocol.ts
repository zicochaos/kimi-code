 * `search/worker` — the RPC protocol between the main-process search worker
 * host (`host.ts`) and the worker thread entry (`entry.ts`).
 *
 * One long-lived worker exclusively owns the `<homeDir>/search-index` MiniDb
 * handle (open/replay, sync, refresh, queries, reindex, close). The protocol
 * is a small request/response envelope over `postMessage` with a versioned
 * ready handshake — deliberately NOT an extension of minidb's bounded
 * text-build worker (a one-shot build runner), which has a different
 * lifecycle.
 *
 * Pure types + constants; safe to import from both sides. The worker entry's
 * import closure runs under Node's native type stripping, so relative
 * imports in this file's closure use explicit `.ts` specifiers.
