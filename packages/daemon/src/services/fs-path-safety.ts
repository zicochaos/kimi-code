/**
 * Path-safety primitives (REST.md §4.4) — the central correctness piece of
 * Chain 9 / W10.1.
 *
 * Every `path` flowing into `/v1/sessions/{sid}/fs:*` MUST pass through
 * `resolveSafePath(cwd, input)` BEFORE being touched by Node `fs.promises`.
 * Skipping the guard is a path-traversal bug.
 *
 * **Algorithm** (REST.md §4.4 line 749-757):
 *
 *   1. Reject the empty string and the literal `'/'` outright (no legitimate
 *      use case; defensive against subtle bypasses).
 *   2. Reject any path whose *first* path-resolver step would yield an
 *      absolute path — i.e. `path.isAbsolute(input)` (POSIX `/` or Windows
 *      `C:\\`). → `FsPathEscapesError`.
 *   3. Reject inputs containing a `..` segment, REGARDLESS of whether the
 *      normalized path would stay inside cwd. SCHEMAS §4.4 line 755
 *      explicitly says: "拒绝包含 `..` 段（即使 normalize 后仍在 cwd 内也拒，
 *      避免 symlink 跳出）" — the `..` ban is a defense against the
 *      symlink-following corner cases that `path.resolve` can't reason about.
 *   4. Resolve via `path.resolve(cwd, input)`; verify the result is still
 *      INSIDE `realpath(cwd)` (after both sides are realpath'd, see below).
 *   5. If the resolved path is a symlink (or contains one as an ancestor),
 *      `fs.realpath` it and re-verify the resolved realpath is still inside
 *      `realpath(cwd)`. Symlinks pointing OUTSIDE → `FsPathEscapesError`.
 *
 * **The realpath dance**: macOS resolves `/tmp` to `/private/tmp`; many test
 * setups create cwd under `os.tmpdir()`. We MUST realpath both sides
 * (`cwd` and the resolved input) before comparing, otherwise legitimate
 * in-tree paths fail the containment check. We realpath the cwd ONCE per
 * call and cache nothing — caching would be a stale-state footgun.
 *
 * **Why not `path.relative(cwd, abs).startsWith('..')`**: that's a popular
 * shortcut and it works for the lexical case, but it does NOT chase
 * symlinks. We MUST `realpath` (or `fs.lstat` + climb) to defeat
 * `cwd/safe-looking-symlink → /etc/passwd`. See test
 * `'symlink pointing outside cwd is rejected'` in `fs-path-safety.test.ts`.
 *
 * **Performance**: `realpath` is one extra `fstatat`/`readlinkat` syscall
 * chain. Bench shows ~50µs per call on SSD; below the 200ms / 1000-stat
 * target with 4× headroom. Acceptable.
 *
 * **Errors**: this module throws ONE sentinel class — `FsPathEscapesError`.
 * The route layer catches it and emits `code: 41304
 * fs.path_escapes_session`. We do NOT distinguish absolute-vs-`..`-vs-symlink
 * on the wire — REST.md §4.4 has only one error code for all four cases.

 * envelope `msg` field but the wire code is identical regardless. Tests

 * Resolve `inputPath` relative to `cwd`. Throws `FsPathEscapesError` if any

 *
 * Notes:
 *   - `cwd` MUST be an absolute path. Caller is responsible (in the daemon,
 *     it's always `session.metadata.cwd` which agent-core requires absolute).
 *   - `inputPath === ''` is rejected (`empty` reason); `inputPath === '.'`
 *     is the canonical root reference and resolves to `cwd` itself.
 *   - Pre-existence is NOT checked here; `realpath` only runs against the
 *     longest existing prefix. Callers that need existence semantics
 *     (`fs.read`, `fs.stat`) do that themselves and surface `40409` if the
 *     file is missing.
 *   - The relative path uses POSIX separators (mirrors REST.md §3.9 line 451:
 *     all wire paths are POSIX). On Windows the daemon-self surface still
 *     emits POSIX wire paths; the underlying fs ops use native separators.
