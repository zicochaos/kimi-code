/**
 * Filesystem lock for single-instance daemon enforcement (ROADMAP P0.12).
 *
 * The lock is a small JSON file at `~/.kimi/daemon/lock` (overridable for
 * tests). It records the live daemon's `pid`, `started_at`, and `port`.
 * Acquisition is exclusive (`O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_EXCL`) — racing daemons
 * can't both win.
 *
 * Stale lock takeover: when a lock file exists, we ping the recorded pid via
 * `process.kill(pid, 0)`. Node's `kill` does NOT send a signal when sig is 0 —
 * it only probes existence (man kill(2)). If the probe throws `ESRCH` the
 * process is gone and we take over by `unlink` + retry. If the probe succeeds
 * (or throws `EPERM`, meaning the process exists but is owned by another user),
 * we throw `EDAEMON_LOCKED` so the caller surfaces the conflict to stderr.
 *
 * Race vs. takeover: the stale-check sees a dead pid, then unlinks, then
 * re-acquires with `O_EXCL`. If a third party slipped in between unlink and
 * re-create, `O_EXCL` returns `EEXIST`, which we propagate (don't loop) — the
 * operator should see the conflict, not silently overwrite.
 *
 * Release is best-effort: if the file is missing or its `pid` no longer
 * matches ours, we log and continue rather than throw. Crashed daemons may
 * leave the file dangling; the next start's stale-check cleans it up.
