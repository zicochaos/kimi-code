/**
 * `/v1/sessions/{sid}/approvals/{aid}` REST route (Chain 5 / P1.5, W8.1).
 *
 * 1 endpoint (REST.md §3.6):
 *
 *   POST   /v1/sessions/{sid}/approvals/{aid}   body: ApprovalResponse
 *                                               data: { resolved: true, resolved_at }
 *
 * Error mapping (REST.md §3.6):
 *   - 40404 (approval.not_found)         — no pending approval matches {aid}
 *   - 40902 (approval.already_resolved)  — second resolve; custom envelope
 *                                          `{code:40902, data:{resolved:false}}`
 *                                          per W7's 40903-pattern
 *   - 40001 (validation.failed)          — bad body via the Zod preHandler
 *
 * **Mechanism**: idempotency is handled by the broker's `isPending()` gate
 * BEFORE calling `resolve()`. The broker drops the entry on resolve, so a
 * second call sees `!isPending` → we emit `40902`. (REST.md §3.6 says
 * `details.resolved_by` should carry the client_id; today we don't track
 * who answered first, so `details` stays absent — fully spec-compliant
 * but conservative.)
 *
 * **Anti-corruption**: route resolves `IApprovalBroker` via the accessor —
 * no SDK imports.
