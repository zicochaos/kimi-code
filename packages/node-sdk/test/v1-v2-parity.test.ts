/**
 * The per-agent projections of the resume comparison, each a genuinely
 * accepted engine gap rather than resume data:
 * - `config.provider`: v1 resolves the full runtime ProviderConfig into the
 *   snapshot; agent-core-v2 has no equivalent read and the v2 client always
 *   reports undefined (the TUI only falls back to `provider?.model` when
 *   `modelAlias` is unset).
 * - `config.systemPrompt`: bootstrap-rendered profile content (engine-owned),
 *   not resume data — it embeds the host's skill listing, whose truncation
 *   the two engines render differently (`…` vs `...`).
 * - `config.profileName` on a MODEL-LESS home: v1
 *   still binds the default profile (and renders its prompt) without a
 *   model, where v2's bind requires a model and deliberately leaves the
 *   agent unbound (the same model-less gap the getStatus parity pins). With
 *   a configured model both bind the same profile and compare in full.
 * - `config.subagentNames`: v1's config snapshot carries the bound profile's
 *   delegatable subagent roster (custom agent files are a v1-engine feature);
 *   v2's resumed agent state has no equivalent field. Engine-owned profile
 *   data, not resume data.
 * - `context.tokenCount`: the KNOWN_DIFFS.getContext divergence (v1's running
 *   estimate vs v2's provider-measured prefix) — the history compares in
 *   full, the count only in the empty state.
 * - replay `config_updated` records: v1 persists the profile BIND as
 *   `config.update` records (which restore maps to config_updated entries);
 *   v2 persists it as a `profile.bind` op the replay fold deliberately does
 *   not translate. Runtime config changes (`config.update`) still fold and
 *   compare — only the bind-time entries exist in these fixtures, so the
 *   type is dropped from both sides.
 * - replay `time`: per-run wall clock. A goal snapshot's `goalId` /
 *   `wallClockMs`: the KNOWN_DIFFS goal rule (per-engine random uuid /
 *   accruing clock).
 * - `plan`: the KNOWN_DIFFS.getPlan rule (random hero-slug id, scrubbed out
 *   of the path after the home scrub).
 * - `tools`: compared as sorted {name, active, source} triples. Tool
 *   DESCRIPTIONS are engine-owned constants that legitimately drift between
 *   the engines (the subagent/cron docs embed engine-specific facts), and
 *   v1 additionally registers the `select_tools` meta tool v2 has no
 *   counterpart for — both are engine design, not resume data. A model-less
 *   agent's roster is not compared at all (v1 initializes builtin tools
 *   only on a profiled agent; v2 exposes them unbound).
