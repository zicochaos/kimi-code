/**
 * Scope-rule lint over the analyzed dep graph.
 *
 * The analyzer resolves each edge's target token to a concrete impl by
 * walking the source's scope tree (source scope → App). If no visible
 * binding exists, the edge is marked `unresolved` — meaning at runtime the
 * DI container would fail to satisfy the dependency from the source's
 * scope. That's exactly the scope-rule violation we want to lint against:
 *
 *   Scope tree:  App > Session > Agent   (App outermost / longest-lived)
 *
 *  - `ctor` edge unresolved     → **error**: container will crash on
 *                                  instantiation.
 *  - `accessor` edge unresolved → **warning**: only fails at `.get()`-time,
 *                                  and calls made under an active inner
 *                                  scope may resolve correctly if the
 *                                  accessor was passed in from that inner
 *                                  scope. Still worth flagging as an
 *                                  implicit dependency on runtime nesting.
 *  - Resolved edges are legal by construction — the analyzer only resolves
 *    if a binding is visible from the source scope.
 *  - `publish` / `subscribe` / `emit` / `on` route through the event bus
 *    token, which is itself ctor-injected; the ctor edge already carries
 *    the check.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm dep-graph:lint         # errors → exit 1
 *   pnpm dep-graph:lint --warn  # also fail on warnings
