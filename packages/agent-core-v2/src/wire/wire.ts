/**
 * `wire` domain — the single Agent-scoped wire aggregate contract.
 *
 * The service owns one Agent's replayable model state and its journal as one
 * consistency boundary: restore reads, validates, migrates, rewrites, replays,
 * rehydrates, and then runs the ordered restore hook. Seal initializes a fresh
 * journal before session metadata makes the Agent visible to legacy readers.
 * Live dispatch applies an Op and appends its record. Callers do not coordinate
 * journal and model state through separate services.
