/**
 * `agentLifecycle` domain (L6) — flat registry of the session's agents.
 *
 * Defines the public contract of agent lifecycle: `create` (from zero, Profile
 * + Model), `fork` (inherit binding + context history), `run` (drive one
 * prompt/retry turn on an agent and await its distilled summary), plus lookup
 * (`getHandle` / `list`) and removal. Hosts the requester-side agent-run hook
 * slot (`hooks.onWillStartAgentTask`) and stop announcement
 * (`onDidStopAgentTask`) that `mirrorAgentRun` runs when one agent drives
 * another, so observers such as the Session-scope `externalHooks` adapter can
 * translate them into external hook commands. Session-scoped — one instance
 * per session.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - The registry is flat: agents have no nesting. There is no parent/child or
 *   caller/callee relationship here; when a business domain needs such a
 *   relationship (e.g. the `Agent` tool's display events), that domain
 *   maintains it itself.
 * - The main agent is an ordinary agent whose only distinction is
 *   `agentId === 'main'`. Business operations (create / fork / run / lookup)
 *   treat it uniformly; the only main-specific surface is the
 *   `onDidCreateMain` event, fired via `notifyMainCreated` by the main
 *   bootstrapper so main-only capabilities subscribe without filtering every
 *   `onDidCreate`.
 * - `forkedFrom` is provenance only (a recorded value); business logic must
 *   not branch on it.
