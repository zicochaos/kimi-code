 * - `first_turn`: the opening user prompt plus the first turn's final
 *   assistant text; strict — unavailable until the first turn has produced
 *   an assistant reply.
 * - `digest`: first user prompt + latest user prompt + the latest turn's
 *   final assistant text, using whatever the (possibly compacted) window
 *   still holds; meant for explicit regeneration on multi-turn sessions.
