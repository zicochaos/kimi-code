/**
 * `persistence/interface` — `IAppendLogStore` contract.
 *
 * The append-log access-pattern store: turns a byte stream into an ordered
 * sequence of typed JSON records on top of `IFileSystemStorageService`. Owns the
 * concerns the storage service deliberately ignores: line framing, batching,
 * and crash-tolerant decoding. Acquired handles share a keyed buffer; its final
 * owner release starts a flush and retires that buffer once the flush settles,
 * before a replacement buffer starts storage I/O for the same key. `rewrite`
 * takes ownership at its call boundary: `records` replaces the history already
 * durable before that cutover, while appends still queued or in flight remain
 * a live tail that is drained after the atomic replacement. Callers must not
 * also include those outstanding appends in `records`. An ambiguous append or
 * rewrite failure remains sticky for that acquired buffer generation so a
 * later flush cannot duplicate data by guessing whether storage committed it.
 * A valid explicit `rewrite` is the recovery boundary: a successful atomic
 * replacement clears that failure before the preserved live tail drains.
 * `flush` and `close` wait for every keyed buffer to settle before reporting
 * the first failure in stable key insertion order.
 *
 * This file ships the interface, error class, and DI token only.
