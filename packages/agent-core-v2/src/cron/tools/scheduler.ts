/**
 * CronScheduler — the scheduling engine.
 *
 * This is the bottom of the cron stack: it knows about tasks, clocks,
 * jitter, and "is the REPL idle?", but nothing about agents, tools,
 * persistence, locks, or the file system. Persistence is layered on
 * top by `CronManager` writing through to per-id JSON files; the
 * scheduler stays oblivious so its tick-loop tests can run with a
 * pure in-memory `source()`.
 *
 * Design notes worth keeping near the code:
 *
 *   - **No direct wall-clock reads.** Every wall-clock read goes
 *     through `clocks.wallNow()`. The companion `no-date-now.test.ts`
 *     enforces this at the file level; bypassing the abstraction
 *     here would break bench / test clock injection.
 *
 *   - **`source()` is called every tick.** It returns the *current*
 *     task list. Callers (the manager) typically wire it to
 *     `() => store.list()`, so creating / deleting tasks between ticks
 *     is picked up automatically. Keep `source()` cheap.
 *
 *   - **`isIdle()` gates fires, not state updates.** When the REPL is
 *     mid-turn we skip firing — but we do NOT advance `lastSeenAt`. The
 *     next idle tick will see the tasks as still due and fire them,
 *     with `coalescedCount` reflecting the gap (so the LLM knows it
 *     missed N ideal fires while the user was talking).
 *
 *   - **`coalescedCount` semantics.** When a sleep / busy turn / system
 *     pause causes the scheduler to miss multiple ideal fires, we
 *     deliver exactly ONE `onFire` call and tell the caller how many
 *     ideal fires we collapsed into it. Floor at 1 — every fire that
 *     happens counts as at least one occurrence.
 *
 *   - **`inFlight` is cleared at end of tick.** `onFire` is synchronous
 *     (the manager's steer is fire-and-forget). The set exists only to
 *     defend against re-entrant ticks within the same call stack — a
 *     theoretical concern, but cheap insurance.
 *
 *   - **Bad tasks do not poison the loop.** Each task's processing is
 *     wrapped in try/catch; failures are swallowed (with an optional
 *     stderr trace gated on `KIMI_CRON_DEBUG=1`) so one busted cron
 *     expression cannot starve the other tasks.
