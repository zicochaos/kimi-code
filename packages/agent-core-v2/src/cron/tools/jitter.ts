/**
 * Per-task deterministic jitter for cron fire times.
 *
 * Why this exists: if every user writes `0 9 * * *` ("every day at 9
 * am") then every CLI fires at the same instant and the upstream API
 * sees a thundering herd at :00. We soften that by shifting each
 * task's ideal fire time by a small, **deterministic** per-task
 * offset so a given task always lands at the same jittered point —
 * reschedules and restarts don't drift, and bench reproducibility
 * stays intact when {@link KIMI_CRON_NO_JITTER} is set.
 *
 * Two flavours:
 *
 *   - **Recurring**: shift *forward* by a fraction of the period
 *     (cap 10% of period, hard cap 15 min). Long-period jobs (`0 9 *
 *     * *`, period 1 day) hit the 15-minute cap; short-period jobs
 *     (`*` /5 * * * *`, period 5 min) are bounded by the 10% rule.
 *
 *   - **One-shot**: shift *earlier* (negative), but only when the
 *     ideal lands on `:00` or `:30` — that's the signal the model
 *     picked a round number with no specific intent. Cap 90 s
 *     earlier. Any other minute (`:07`, `:23`, …) passes through
 *     unchanged because the model presumably meant that exact time.
 *
 * The function is pure given its inputs — no module-level cache; the
 * hash is recomputed from `task.id` each call. That trades a handful
 * of cheap arithmetic ops for a guarantee that there is no hidden
 * state to invalidate when a task is rescheduled.
