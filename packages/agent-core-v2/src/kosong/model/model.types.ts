/**
 * `kosong/model` domain — shared pure-data types no single contract owns.
 *
 * One home for the small data interfaces that would otherwise each sit in a
 * near-empty file:
 *   - `ModelOverrides` — the resolved `modelOverrides` effective config
 *     section (populated by the `KIMI_MODEL_*` env overlay). Consumers fold it
 *     into `ModelRequestParams`: `temperature`/`topP` into `sampling`,
 *     `thinkingKeep` into the thinking intent, `maxCompletionTokens` into the
 *     completion budget. Each wire dialect encodes (or drops) the resulting
 *     intent in its own hooks.
 *   - `CompletionBudgetConfig` / `CompletionBudgetParams` — the budget knobs
 *     resolved and folded by the domain's pure budget functions.
 *   - `ResolvedModelAuthMaterial` — the credential material resolved out of
 *     the Model → Provider precedence chain.
 *   - `ThinkingDefaults` / `ModelThinkingMetadata` — the inputs the effective
 *     thinking effort/keep is resolved from.
 *
 * Types only — the functions and services that produce or consume them stay
 * in their own files.
