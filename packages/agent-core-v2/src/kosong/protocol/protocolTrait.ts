/**
 * `kosong/protocol` domain (L1) — the declarative trait surface.
 *
 * A `ProtocolTrait` is a stateless declaration of how one vendor deviates
 * from a wire base: seventeen fully optional hooks plus rare metadata markers
 * (non-function fields like `strictThinkingValidation` that qualify how a
 * hook's behavior is governed, without adding a code path). A trait declares
 * a deviation only where one exists; a hook returning `undefined` always
 * means "keep the base default".
 *
 * Composition rules (the L2 compositors implement them; they are restated
 * here because they are part of the trait contract):
 *
 *  - Pipeline hooks (`convertMessage` / `mergeHistory` / `buildParams`)
 *    chain in trait order, each receiving the previous stage's output.
 *    `convertMessage` may additionally return `null` to drop the message.
 *  - Single-value hooks are overwritten in trait order: last declarer wins.
 *  - `convertError` is consulted by the bases with each RAW failure exactly
 *    once — the SDK error on HTTP paths, the raw event on in-stream paths —
 *    after the abort guard (a cancellation never reaches it) and after the
 *    already-converted `ChatProviderError` pass-through. The hook exists
 *    because base conversion drops vendor-parsed detail such as the body
 *    `error.type`/`error.code`; it is where a vendor declares what its own
 *    wire errors mean (e.g. which 429s are a non-retryable quota
 *    exhaustion rather than a transient rate limit).
 *  - `endpoint` / `defaultHeaders` / `provides` are construction-time
 *    declarations aggregated by the contrib factories, not per-request hooks.
 *
 * `TraitContext` carries only `{ config, providerId? }` — never the vendor
 * definition object. That is the detail that makes the L1↛L2 layering hold:
 * traits see configuration, not registry state.
