/**
 * Clock sources for the cron scheduler.
 *
 * Two distinct notions of time are kept apart on purpose:
 *
 *   1. wall-clock — what the user perceives as "the current time". Used
 *      for cron expression matching, `createdAt`, and the 7-day stale
 *      judgment. May be overridden in tests / multi-process benches so
 *      that scenarios can run in simulated time without `setTimeout`.
 *
 *   2. monotonic ms — a strictly non-decreasing counter that never
 *      jumps backwards across NTP adjustments, suspend/resume, or
 *      simulated-clock injection. Used for the poll cadence and the
 *      lock heartbeat — anything where "did 5 seconds elapse since we
 *      last looked" must hold even when the wall clock is frozen.
 *
 * Mixing the two pollutes test reproducibility: a heartbeat tied to
 * `wallNow()` will appear stuck when the test clock is frozen; a cron
 * fire tied to `monoNowMs()` will not advance when the bench rewinds
 * the simulated day. Every component in the cron domain MUST take a
 * `ClockSources` and route every time read through it.
 *
 * `monoNowMs` is ALWAYS `process.hrtime.bigint()` (converted to ms).
 * It is not overridable — accepting an external monotonic clock would
 * defeat the safety net the lock heartbeat depends on.
 *
 * `wallNow` resolution is driven by the `KIMI_CRON_CLOCK` env var; see
 * `resolveClockSources` below. Defaults to `Date.now()`.

 *   `"file:<path>"`      → `wallNow` reads the first line of `<path>`
 *                          on every call (sync — the tick path is not
 *                          async) and parses it as `Number(...)`. A
 *                          missing file or bad parse falls back to
 *                          `Date.now()` for that call. Used so a

 *                          file-backed simulated clock.
 *
 * `monoNowMs` ALWAYS uses `process.hrtime.bigint()`. No spec overrides
 * it — see file header.
 *
 * Each `wallNow()` call re-reads its source. We deliberately do NOT
 * cache, because a multi-process bench tick mutating the file must be
 * picked up by every reader immediately; a cache would silently lock
 * each process to its first observation.
 *
 * Unrecognised specs fall back to {@link SYSTEM_CLOCKS} (with a
 * debug-log on stderr). This is deliberate — bricking the agent on a
 * typoed bench env var would be worse than running with system time.
