/**
 * `skillCatalog` domain (L3) — skill-source contract.
 *
 * `ISkillSource` is the producer half of the skill subsystem: each source loads
 * a `SkillContribution` and advertises a `priority` so the Session sink can
 * ordered-merge contributions (higher priority wins name collisions). Sources
 * PUSH into the sink; the sink is a dumb ordered-merge table. File-backed
 * sources additionally carry the load diagnostics (`skipped`, `scannedRoots`)
 * produced by `ISkillDiscovery`, which the sink folds into the merged catalog;
 * ad-hoc contributions omit them. Concrete sources (builtin/user at App scope,
 * extra/workspace/plugin at Session scope) each bind their own DI token
 * extending this contract.
