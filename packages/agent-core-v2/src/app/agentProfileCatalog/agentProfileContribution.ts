/**
 * `agentProfileCatalog` domain — the agent-profile Contribution shape and
 * source priorities.
 *
 * `AgentProfileContribution` is the Contribution of the agent-profile
 * extension point: the plain data structure a loader registers into the
 * App-scope `IAgentProfileRegistry` under its source id. It is pure payload —
 * the source id and priority are registration metadata passed to `register`,
 * never part of the contribution. Name-level dedup is NOT done here or in the
 * registry; it is the Session catalog's projection job.
 *
 * `AGENT_PROFILE_SOURCE_PRIORITY` orders the sources for that projection
 * (higher wins name collisions), with one deliberate deviation from the skill
 * system: `explicit` outranks every other source (in the skill system it
 * aliases `user`) because `--agent-file` is a one-shot command-line intent
 * that must always win.
