/**
 * `hostProcess` domain (L1) — the OS process-spawning contract.
 *
 * Defines `IHostProcessService`, the App-scope primitive used by any domain that
 * needs to spawn a child process on the host, plus the `IHostProcess` handle it
 * returns. The contract is deliberately close to Python `subprocess.Popen` /
 * `os.spawn*`: a single `spawn()` call returns a handle exposing stdin/stdout/
 * stderr, the pid, the exit code, and lifecycle methods. Bound at App scope;
 * backends in `os/backends/node-local` provide the Node implementation.
