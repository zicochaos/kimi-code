/**
 * `fullCompaction` domain (L4) — wire Model (`CompactionModel`) and the
 * `full_compaction.begin` (`fullCompactionBegin`) / `full_compaction.cancel`
 * (`fullCompactionCancel`) / `full_compaction.complete`
 * (`fullCompactionComplete`) Ops that mirror the full-compaction lifecycle into
 * a persisted, replayable phase, plus the `compaction.*` edge events
 * (`started` / `blocked` / `cancelled` / `completed`) declared on `DomainEventMap`
 * (`compaction.started` is derived from the `full_compaction.begin` Op's
 * `toEvent`; the rest publish directly from the service).
 *
 * The Model is intentionally phase-only — `{ phase }` (initial `idle`). The
 * richer per-compaction data (`instruction`, `compactedCount`, `tokensBefore`,
 * `tokensAfter`) is NOT resume state: `instruction` is only needed by the live
 * worker (which does not survive a restart) and by telemetry, so it rides the
 * `begin` payload (and is persisted on the record for audit) but is not stored
 * in the Model; the result numbers are consumed live by the
 * `compaction.completed` signal and their durable effect (the summary message)
 * already lives in `contextMemory`. They are still carried on the `complete`
 * payload so the persisted record stays byte-compatible with the legacy wire
 * log, but `apply` ignores them and collapses to `idle`. Each `apply` returns
 * the same reference on a no-op so the wire's reference-equality gate stays
 * quiet; it carries no non-determinism.
 *
 * The runtime orchestration — `ActiveCompaction`, its `AbortController`, and
 * the in-flight worker promise — stays OUT of the Model (live-only service
 * members): none of it can be resumed, and a session never restores mid-flight.
 * A `running` phase stranded by a crash is reset to `idle` by the service's
 * `wire.onRestored` handler (mirroring `goal`'s post-replay normalization).
 *
 * The `compaction.*` events publish to `IEventBus` (`compaction.started` via the
 * `begin` Op's `toEvent`; the rest directly) and also emit live through
 * `wire.signal` (legacy channel, until Phase 3); they are declared here via
 * interface-merge (`error` is already declared by `mcp`, so it is not
 * re-declared). The `full_compaction.*` record shapes stay declared in
 * `WireRecordMap` (see `fullCompactionService.ts`) because the records still
 * ride the per-agent `wire.jsonl` log read by `wireRecord.restore()` /
 * `getRecords()` — `microCompaction` registers a `full_compaction.complete`
 * resumer against that stream. Consumed by the Agent-scope `fullCompactionService`.
