/**
 * `tools` domain — `ICronDeleteTool` implementation.
 *
 * CronDeleteTool — cancel a scheduled cron job by id.
 *
 * The tool's job is intentionally narrow: validate the id shape, ask the
 * service to drop the entry, and report whether anything was actually
 * removed. The scheduler picks up the deletion on its next `tick()`
 * automatically because the task set is re-read every pass — there is no
 * separate "unsubscribe" handshake to keep in sync.
 *
 * Why "not found" is reported as an error:
 *
 *   - The model uses the result string to decide whether to follow up
 *     (e.g. confirm to the user, retry, or move on). Returning a
 *     success-shaped message for a no-op would silently teach the model
 *     that CronDelete is idempotent against missing ids, which it is
 *     not — the next `CronList` would still show whatever id the model
 *     thought it deleted. Surfacing `isError: true` lets the model
 *     correct itself (typically by calling `CronList` again).
 *
 * Why the service is not consulted for telemetry on the not-found
 * branch:
 *
 *   - `cron_deleted` records an actual state change. Emitting it on a
 *     miss would inflate the metric and break parity with `cron_create`
 *     (which never fires on a rejected schedule). The branch is fully
 *     observable through tool-call telemetry already.
 *
 * Refresh-cron pattern this tool participates in:
 *
 *   When `CronList` (or a fired job's origin) reports `stale: true`, the
 *   documented "refresh" flow is `CronDelete(id)` followed by a fresh
 *   `CronCreate` with the same cron + prompt. That resets `createdAt`,
 *   clears the stale flag, and rejoins the herd-avoidance jitter draw
 *   with a new task id. The doc string spells this out so the model can
 *   reach for it without prompting from a system message.
 *
 * Collaborators: `ISessionCronService` for task removal
 * and telemetry emission, and `IAgentScopeContext` for the emitting agent
 * id. Bound at Agent scope.
