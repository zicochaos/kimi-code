/**
 * `media` domain (L4) — image compression for model ingestion.
 *
 * Shrink oversized images before they reach the model.
 *
 * A multimodal request carries each image as a base64 data URL; an unbounded
 * screenshot or photo wastes context tokens and can blow past the provider's
 * per-image byte ceiling. This module downsamples and re-encodes such images
 * so they fit a pixel + byte budget, while leaving already-small images
 * untouched — the common case is a fast, codec-free pass-through.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *  - Pure JS (jimp), imported lazily so the codec is only paid for when an
 *    image actually needs work; startup and the fast path stay cheap.
 *  - Best effort: any decode/encode failure returns the original bytes
 *    unchanged (`changed: false`), so a compression problem never blocks a
 *    prompt. Callers simply send the original instead.
 *  - Only PNG and JPEG are re-encoded. GIF is passed through to preserve
 *    animation; WebP is passed through because the default jimp build ships no
 *    WebP codec. Unknown formats are passed through.
 *  - Compression must never be silent to the model: results carry the
 *    original dimensions, {@link buildImageCompressionCaption} renders the
 *    shared "what was compressed, where is the original" note every ingestion
 *    point can place next to the image, and {@link cropImageForModel} lets a
 *    caller read a region of the original back at full fidelity. In user
 *    prompts the prompt layer later reroutes that note through the hidden
 *    system-reminder injection via {@link extractImageCompressionCaptions},
 *    so its raw `<system>` markup never renders in the UI.
