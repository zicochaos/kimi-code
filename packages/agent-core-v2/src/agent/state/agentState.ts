/**
 * `state` domain (L1) — Agent-scope keyed state container contract.
 *
 * Defines `IAgentStateService`, the Agent-scope state service: Agent-tier
 * services declare their plain-data state as typed keys (`defineState` from
 * `_base`) and read/write them through this container, so per-agent shared
 * state lives in one observable place and dies with the agent. Shares the
 * `IStateRegistry` method set with its App/Session counterparts. Bound at
 * Agent scope.
