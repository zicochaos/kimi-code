/**
 * `loop` domain (L4) — the step queue held by `AgentLoopService`.
 *
 * Turn-owned FIFO with head insertion: senders enqueue `StepRequest`s (tail
 * for ordered work, head for retries of a failed step), and one Turn drains
 * its queue one batch per step. A batch is one *driver* (the first
 * non-mergeable request) plus every *mergeable* request folded into the
 * driver's step — this is how steers land in the same LLM request as pending
 * tool results or a fresh prompt instead of each costing its own step. Extra
 * non-mergeable requests stay queued and drive later steps. Aborted requests
 * are discarded when reached, leaving the context untouched. When a run ends,
 * turn-scoped requests are aborted while agent-scoped requests (steers) carry
 * into the next turn.
