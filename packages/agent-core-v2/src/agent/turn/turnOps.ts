/**
 * `turn` domain (L4) — wire Model (`TurnModel`) and the `turn.prompt` Op
 * (`promptTurn`) that advances the agent's monotonically-increasing turn id.
 *
 * Declares the next turn id as a wire Model (initial `0`) plus the Op whose
 * `apply` is the pure extraction of the former live `restorePrompt` facet:
 * `nextTurnId` becomes `max(current, turnId + 1)` for an integer payload,
 * returning the same reference when the payload does not advance the counter
 * (so the wire's reference-equality gate stays quiet). Every turn is launched
 * through `turnService.launch`, so the counter is fully restored from `turn.prompt`
 * records alone (no separate observe mechanism is needed). The `turn.started` /
 * `turn.ended` / `error` signals are not part of this Op and remain on their
 * existing path. Consumed by the Agent-scope `turnService`.
 *
 * `turn.launch` (`launchTurn`) is the pre-1.4 record type: it stays registered so
 * sessions written at wire protocol 1.5 still replay (restored via the
 * newer-version passthrough, no migration), but the live write path no longer
 * emits it.
