/**
 * `storage` domain — the bottom-most persistence substrate.
 *
 * `IStorageService` is the single, backend-pluggable byte store that every
 * other local-persistence abstraction is built on. It exposes the two
 * irreducible durable primitives side by side:
 *
 *   - `write`  — atomic whole-value replacement (the `Config` access pattern).
 *   - `append` — ordered, durable byte extension   (the `Record` access pattern).
 *
 * They are not interchangeable: building `append` on top of `write` is O(n)
 * per append, and building `write` on top of `append` yields awkward "read
 * the last value" semantics. Keeping both as first-class primitives lets each
 * implementation implement them optimally (file: `open('a')` vs tmp+rename;
 * db: `INSERT` vs `UPSERT`).
 *
 * The service is intentionally byte-oriented and scope/key-addressed: it knows
 * nothing about JSON, records, configs, versions or framing. Those concerns
 * live in the typed facades above it (`IAppendLogStore`, `IAtomicDocumentStore`).
 *
 * `scope`/`key` are trusted internal path segments for the file implementation
 * (e.g. scope `"agents/main"`, key `"wire.jsonl"`); they are not user input.
