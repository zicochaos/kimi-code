# Config files

Kimi Code CLI stores its global configuration in a single TOML file that covers API providers, model aliases, agent loop parameters, background tasks, external services, and more. This page describes the location of the config file, its top-level fields, each nested structure, and a complete example.

## Config file location

The default config file is located at `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`. The directory and file are created automatically on first run with restrictive permissions.

If you want to place the data directory elsewhere, set the `KIMI_CODE_HOME` environment variable:

```sh
export KIMI_CODE_HOME=/path/to/kimi-home
```

The config file path then becomes `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/config.toml`. Regardless of where the directory lives, the file name is always `config.toml`.

::: tip
TOML field names always use snake_case (for example, `default_model`, `max_context_size`). If a key contains `.`, you must use a quoted TOML key; otherwise TOML will treat `.` as a nested table separator.

## Top-level fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `default_model` | `string` | — | Default model alias; must be defined in `models` |
| `default_thinking` | `boolean` | `false` | Initial value of the Thinking toggle for new sessions; can be flipped from the model menu inside a session. Even when this is `true`, setting `[thinking].mode = "off"` will still force Thinking off. See [`thinking`](#thinking) below |
| `default_permission_mode` | `string` | `manual` | Default permission mode for new sessions; one of `manual`, `auto`, `yolo` |
| `default_plan_mode` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether new sessions start in Plan mode by default; omitting it is equivalent to `false` |
| `merge_all_available_skills` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether to merge Agent Skills from all available directories |
| `extra_skill_dirs` | `array<string>` | — | Extra skill search directories, layered on top of the default directories |
| `telemetry` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether anonymous telemetry is enabled; only disabled when explicitly set to `false` |
| `providers` | `table` | `{}` | API provider table; see below |
| `models` | `table` | — | Model alias table; see below |
| `thinking` | `table` | — | Default parameters for Thinking mode |
| `loop_control` | `table` | — | Agent loop control parameters |
| `background` | `table` | — | Background task runtime parameters |
| `services` | `table` | — | Built-in external service configuration |
| `permission` | `table` | — | Permission rule configuration; see below |
| `hooks` | `array<table>` | — | Lifecycle hook configuration. See [Hooks](../customization/hooks.md) |

```

## `providers`

Each entry in the `providers` table defines the connection info for one API provider, keyed by a unique name.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `string` | Yes | Provider type; one of `anthropic`, `openai`, `kimi`, `google-genai`, `openai_responses`, `vertexai` |
| `api_key` | `string` | No | API key |
| `base_url` | `string` | No | API base URL |
| `oauth` | `table` | No | OAuth credential reference; see below |
| `env` | `table<string, string>` | No | A configuration sub-table keyed by provider-specific names (such as `KIMI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`), used as fallback values for `api_key` / `base_url` and related fields. This is just a sub-table inside the config file — **it is not written into your shell environment** — and is consulted only when the corresponding field on `[providers.<name>]` is unset |
| `custom_headers` | `table<string, string>` | No | Custom HTTP headers attached to each request |

OAuth credential reference structure:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `storage` | `string` | Yes | Credential storage location; currently only `file` is supported |
| `key` | `string` | Yes | Unique identifier of the credential entry |

```toml
[providers.openai]
type = "openai"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-xxx"
custom_headers = { "X-Custom-Header" = "value" }
```

## `models`

Each entry in the `models` table defines a model alias, keyed by a unique name.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `provider` | `string` | Yes | Name of the provider to use; must be defined in `providers` |
| `model` | `string` | Yes | Model identifier used when calling the API |
| `max_context_size` | `integer` | Yes | Maximum context length in tokens; must be at least 1 |
| `max_output_size` | `integer` | No | Per-request output budget cap (`max_tokens` on the wire). Only the `anthropic` provider currently honors it. When the alias resolves to a known Claude family, the value is clamped to that model's documented ceiling to avoid exceeding the server-side limit. Omit to use the per-model default — see [`providers.md`](./providers.md#anthropic). |
| `capabilities` | `array<string>` | No | Capability tags to add explicitly, for example `thinking`, `image_in`, `video_in`, `audio_in`, `tool_use` |
| `display_name` | `string` | No | Name shown in the UI; falls back to `model` when unset |
| `reasoning_key` | `string` | No | `openai` provider only. Override the field name used for reasoning content. By default the provider auto-detects `reasoning_content`, `reasoning_details`, and `reasoning` on incoming responses and serializes thinking back as `reasoning_content` — set this only if your gateway uses a non-standard field name |

`capabilities` is unioned with the capabilities that the provider capability registry matches by model-name prefix — entries can only be added, never removed. You usually do not need to set this by hand; reach for it only when the model is not covered by the registry, or when you want to force-enable a particular capability.

If a model alias contains `.`, use a quoted key:

```toml
[models."gpt-4.1"]
provider = "openai"
model = "gpt-4.1"
max_context_size = 1047576
```

For testing, you can also synthesize a model entirely from `KIMI_MODEL_*` environment variables without editing this file — see [Define a model from environment variables](./env-vars.md#define-a-model-from-environment-variables-kimi-model).

## `thinking`

`thinking` controls the default behavior of Thinking mode. Even when the top-level `default_thinking = true`, setting `mode` to `"off"` will still force Thinking off.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | `string` | — | Trigger policy; one of `auto`, `on`, `off`. `"off"` forces Thinking off; any other value or omission does not disable it, and the effective behavior is decided together by the per-session Thinking toggle and `effort` |
| `effort` | `string` | `high` | Default effort level used when Thinking is on; one of `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`. The levels actually available depend on the provider |

## `loop_control`

`loop_control` governs the step count, retries, and context compaction threshold of the agent execution loop.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `max_steps_per_turn` | `integer` | — | Maximum number of steps per turn; set to `0` or leave unset for unlimited. Setting `0` is useful for overriding a previously configured limit. |
| `max_retries_per_step` | `integer` | `3` | Maximum retries per step |
| `reserved_context_size` | `integer` | — | Number of tokens reserved for response generation; compaction is triggered when the context approaches this threshold |



## `background`

`background` controls the runtime limits for background tasks. Background tasks are launched through the `Bash` tool or the `Agent` tool's `run_in_background=true` parameter.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `max_running_tasks` | `integer` | — | Maximum number of background tasks running concurrently |
| `keep_alive_on_exit` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether to keep still-running background tasks when the session closes. Set to `false` to request stopping background tasks when `kimi -p` finishes and exits, when an SDK session closes, or when a harness closes |
| `agent_task_timeout_s` | `integer` | — | Maximum runtime in seconds for background agent tasks |

`keep_alive_on_exit` can be overridden by the `KIMI_CODE_BACKGROUND_KEEP_ALIVE_ON_EXIT` environment variable; the environment variable has higher priority than `config.toml`. The schema also reserves `kill_grace_period_ms` and `print_wait_ceiling_s`; these fields currently pass schema validation only and are not read by the CLI runtime.

## `services`

`services` configures the built-in external services Kimi Code CLI calls. Only the two fixed keys `moonshot_search` (web search) and `moonshot_fetch` (web fetch) are recognized; other keys are ignored. Both entries share the same fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `base_url` | `string` | No | Service API URL |
| `api_key` | `string` | No | API key |
| `oauth` | `table` | No | OAuth credential reference, same structure as `providers.*.oauth` |
| `custom_headers` | `table<string, string>` | No | Custom HTTP headers attached to each request |

```toml
[services.moonshot_search]
base_url = "https://api.moonshot.cn/v1/search"
api_key = "sk-xxx"

[services.moonshot_fetch]
base_url = "https://api.moonshot.cn/v1/fetch"
api_key = "sk-xxx"
```

## `permission`

`permission` configures the initial permission rules loaded when a session starts, controlling the default approval behavior for tool calls. The default permission mode for new sessions is controlled by the top-level `default_permission_mode` field; an explicit startup permission mode, such as the CLI's `--yolo` flag, overrides that default.

Rules are written as a `[[permission.rules]]` array of tables, where each rule contains the following fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `decision` | `string` | Yes | Decision result; one of `allow`, `deny`, `ask` |
| `scope` | `string` | No | Rule scope; one of `turn-override`, `session-runtime`, `project`, `user`; defaults to `user` |
| `pattern` | `string` | Yes | Match pattern in the form `ToolName` or `ToolName(arg-pattern)`. `ToolName` must match the runtime tool name exactly — built-in tools are `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Grep`, and so on (see [Built-in tools](../reference/tools.md)). Argument patterns are interpreted only by tools with built-in argument matchers, such as `Bash`, file tools, and search tools; MCP tools and custom tools match by tool name only |
| `reason` | `string` | No | Rule description for debugging or auditing |

Example:

```toml
[[permission.rules]]
decision = "allow"
pattern = "Read"

[[permission.rules]]
decision = "allow"
pattern = "Grep"

[[permission.rules]]
decision = "deny"
pattern = "Bash(rm -rf*)"

[[permission.rules]]
decision = "ask"
pattern = "Bash"
```

::: tip
MCP server declarations are configured in `~/.kimi-code/mcp.json` or the project-local `.kimi-code/mcp.json`, not in `config.toml`. The interactive configuration entry point is `/mcp-config`; see [Model Context Protocol](../customization/mcp.md).
