# Agent service migration TODO

This tracks logic and behavior gaps in `packages/agent-core/src/services/agent`
against the current implementation under `packages/agent-core/src/agent`.

## PromptService / input flow

- [x] Implement `undo(count)` in `PromptService`.
- [x] Implement `clear()` in `PromptService`.
- [x] Make active-turn `steer()` enter at a step boundary instead of waiting for the whole turn to finish.
- [x] Replace plain active-turn errors with `KimiError(ErrorCodes.TURN_AGENT_BUSY)`.
- [x] Keep `retry()` origin-free for now; no current service logic consumes retry origin.
- [ ] Add replay/resume equivalents for prompt/steer if the service layer takes over wire replay.
- [ ] Add user prompt hook behavior if hooks remain outside `TurnRunner`.

## ContextMemory

- [x] Own the `context.splice` wire record declaration and replay application.

## Loop Transcript Assembly

- [x] Handle loop events: `step.begin`, streamed content, tool calls, tool results, and `step.end`.

## ToolRegistry / ToolExecutor

- [x] Preserve existing tool error semantics.

## PlanMode

- [x] Track plan id.
- [x] Generate and expose plan file paths.
- [x] Create plan directories/files and roll back failed enter operations.

## DynamicInjector

- [x] Fix `injectedAt` bookkeeping for self-inserted injection messages.
- [x] Add clear, compaction, and message-removal lifecycle handling.
